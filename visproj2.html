                    <p>This project involves the development of a pathfinding simulation using the A* search algorithm
                        to control an unmanned vehicle as it navigates through a grid environment filled with obstacles.
                        Built in Java Processing, the project provides a visual and interactive representation of
                        real-time pathfinding, demonstrating how the A* algorithm can effectively determine optimal
                        routes for navigation. The main objective was to refine an efficient pathfinding system suitable
                        for unmanned surface vehicles, focusing on overcoming dynamic challenges within a constrained
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>The application uses a grid-based environment where each cell can represent either a passable
                        area or an obstacle. The vehicle starts from a predefined position, and the user can choose
                        target destinations by pressing corresponding keys. For example, pressing keys 'a', 'b', 'c',
                        'd', or 's' sets different target locations, and the A* algorithm calculates the most efficient
                        path to the selected target. Once the path is determined, the vehicle navigates along the
                        optimal route in real-time. The A* algorithm, a well-known heuristic-based search technique, is
                        applied to determine the most efficient path, avoiding obstacles and minimizing travel distance.
                        The project also features a graphical interface that visually represents the pathfinding
                        process, including the exploration of possible routes and the final path selection. The
                        real-time movement of the vehicle on the grid enhances user interaction, making it easy to
                        understand the effectiveness of the A* algorithm in different scenarios.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the development, key concepts such as heuristic calculation, node-based navigation,
                        and path reconstruction were implemented to ensure optimal pathfinding performance. The
                        graphical interface provides clear visual feedback, showing the vehicle's movement as well as
                        the nodes that are being explored during the search process.</p>
                    <p>This project was undertaken as part of the Macquarie University Undergraduate Research Workshop,
                        where I was introduced to the principles, rationale, and methodology of research, including
                        project management, as well as qualitative and quantitative analysis. It was an opportunity to
                        investigate and refine the use of pathfinding algorithms such as A*, focusing on practical
                        applications like unmanned vehicle navigation, and developing a deeper understanding of their
                        effectiveness in dynamic scenarios. The GitHub repository for this project can be accessed <a
