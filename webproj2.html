                        <h1>Wali Shop - An Online Shopping Platform</h1>
                    </header>
                    <p>WaliShop is a simple yet comprehensive React-based online shopping platform developed as part of the
                        COMP3120 course at Macquarie University. The project was built to
                        provide users with an intuitive online shopping experience, featuring functionalities such as
                        product listings, user profile management, cart operations, and order history. The platform
                        leverages React for the frontend, utilizing React Router for seamless navigation and Axios for
                        handling API calls, while the backend is implemented with Express.js to manage data and provide
                        essential API endpoints. The application is accessible at <a
                            href="https://walishop.onrender.com"><strong>WaliShop</strong></a>.
                    </p>
                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/web_proj2_item.png" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>The platform includes several key features designed to offer a complete online shopping
                        experience:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Product Listing and Details: Users can browse through a variety of products, view detailed
                            information, and filter products by category or tags. Each product page provides relevant
                            details including title, description, vendor, and price.</li>

                        <li>User Profiles: Users can create and manage their profiles, ensuring personalized experiences
                            across the platform.</li>

                        <li>Cart Management: The cart functionality allows users to add products, adjust quantities, and
                            remove items, with dynamic price calculations to keep track of the total cost.</li>

                        <li>Checkout and Order History: Users can proceed to checkout from their cart and confirm their
                            orders. The order history feature provides users with a record of past transactions,
                            allowing them to easily track their purchases.</li>

                        <li>Responsive Design: The frontend design of WaliShop is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth
                            and visually appealing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/web_proj2_cart.png" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>During development, several tools and technologies were employed to enhance the application's
                        functionality. Axios was used for efficient API calls, while React Hooks were implemented to
                        manage component state and side effects. The backend utilized
                        Express.js, with CORS enabled to allow cross-origin requests, and data was managed through a
                        local JSON file to simulate a database for product and user information. The server provides
                        various API endpoints for products, users, categories, tags, and orders, ensuring the
                        application remains dynamic and user-friendly.</p>
                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/web_proj2_checkout.png" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>This project demonstrates skills in both frontend and backend development, with a focus on
                        building a user-centered shopping platform that meets the requirements of a modern e-commerce
                        application. Due to academic integrity policies of Macquarie University, the repository
                        containing the code and supporting documents is private, but it can be shared with potential
                        recruiters upon request from <a
