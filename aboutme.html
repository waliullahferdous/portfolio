						<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

					<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
					<p>I am Wali Ferdous, an aspiring Ethical Hacker and versatile developer passionate about creating
						secure, efficient, and engaging digital
						solutions. I graduated with a Bachelor of Cyber Security from Macquarie University, achieving a
						WAM of 86+ and earning the Macquarie
						University Award for Academic Excellence - a prestigious award given to select graduates with a
						WAM above 85 - as well as consistent recognition
						on the High Achieverâ€™s Merit List. Currently, I am a Casual Academic at the University of Sydney
						and have previously held academic roles at Macquarie University, where I am committed to
						fostering a deep understanding of technology through
						teaching and mentorship. With a strong academic foundation in Cyber Security, I have developed a
						comprehensive skill set across cybersecurity,
						data analysis, full-stack development, graphic design, and visual applications.</p>
					<p>In cyber security, I have developed a robust skill set in penetration testing, digital forensics,
						risk management, and vulnerability assessment, with
						expertise in areas like attacking web applications, information gathering, SQL injections, web
						proxies, and JavaScript deobfuscation, among
						others. I am currently working on obtaining certifications like CPTS, CBBH, CEH, OSCP,
						Security+, and Network+ to further validate and expand
						my expertise. My approach is driven by a commitment to secure digital environments, blending
						technical knowledge with a deep understanding of
						cybersecurity principles. As a data analyst, I bring a keen eye for detail and a methodical
						approach to data-driven problem-solving. My experience spans data cleaning,
						exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning, where I utilize techniques such
						as regression analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors,
						and more advanced algorithms. I work extensively with Python, R and SQL for data manipulation, as
						well as Tableau and Power BI for business
						analysis, creating dashboards and reports that highlight strengths, weaknesses, and provide
						actionable recommendations. This analytical
						proficiency allows me to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and translate them into
						impactful outcomes. </p>
					<p>In full-stack development, I have worked on web, mobile app, and software development projects,
						focusing on delivering seamless and functional
						user experiences. As a project leader, I have guided teams through the development process,
						bringing innovative project ideas to life and
						applying Agile methodologies to ensure efficiency, adaptability, and continuous improvement. My
						experience spans a range of standard
						technologies, including the MERN, MEAN, MEVN, and Django-React-MySQL stacks, 
						for web development, as well as Flutter, Swift, and Kotlin for mobile app
						development and C++, Java, SQLite, MySQL, and AWS services (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB) for software development. With a strong foundation in
						cybersecurity, I approach development from a
						security-first perspective, ensuring that applications are not only user-friendly but also
						fortified against vulnerabilities. I am skilled
						at managing both the front-end and back-end aspects of applications, from crafting intuitive
						user interfaces to designing robust backend
						architectures. With a strong focus on collaboration and iterative development, I strive to
						create applications that maintain high standards
						of technical functionality, performance, and security.

					<p>My passion for graphic design has led me to create logos, posters, and branding materials that
						communicate visually compelling narratives. I
						enjoy merging design principles with a practical focus on user experience, ensuring that each
						project not only looks appealing but also
						serves its functional purpose effectively. In visual applications and game development, I
						explore innovative ways to engage users through
						interactive elements. From creating visually rich applications to experimenting with pathfinding
						algorithms for game mechanics, I enjoy
						leveraging computational and design principles to produce dynamic, immersive experiences.</p>
					<p>Each of these fields reflects my commitment to lifelong learning and innovation. As I move
						forward in my career, I am eager to apply my diverse
						skill set to projects that enhance digital security, foster creativity, and provide meaningful
						user experiences.</p>
