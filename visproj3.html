                    <p>This Mario-inspired game project was developed using Processing, providing players with a
                        nostalgic yet unique gaming experience. The game combines traditional platforming mechanics such
                        as coin collection, obstacle navigation, and enemy encounters, all while immersing the player in
                        a dynamic and visually engaging environment.</p>
                    <p>The game includes various features that enhance the overall experience:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dynamic Background and Day-Night Cycle: The game environment features a continuously
                            transitioning day-night cycle, including sun and moon movement, along with stars appearing
                            during nighttime. Players experience a changing sky and shifting light effects, adding depth
                            to the visuals.</li>

                        <li>Weather Effects: Rain can occur randomly, with animated raindrops falling across the screen,
                            creating an additional layer of challenge and visual interest.</li>

                        <li>Platforming Mechanics: Players control Mario's movements, including running and jumping,
                            while avoiding obstacles such as pipes with spikes, and interacting with enemies that roam
                            the levels. The game provides responsive physics, making jumps feel natural and engaging.
                        </li>

                        <li>Coin Collection and Score Tracking: The player can collect coins placed throughout the game
                            world, contributing to the score. Coins are animated to add a sparkle effect, enhancing
                            their visibility and appeal.</li>

                        <li>Enemy Encounters and Obstacles: Enemies move across the screen, requiring players to avoid
                            them to prevent game over. Obstacles like pipes also present a challenge that players must
                            navigate.</li>

                        <li>Game Over and Restart Mechanics: If Mario collides with an enemy or an obstacle, the game
                            ends, displaying a "Game Over" message with an option to restart.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>These features are designed to create an interactive and immersive gameplay experience,
                        reminiscent of classic platformers. The game's background elements such as clouds, hills, and
                        trees move to create a sense of depth, while the physics-based mechanics and enemy AI add
                        complexity and challenge to the gameplay. Furthermore, the game has been designed with
                        scalability in mind, allowing for the addition of multiple levels with progressively increasing
                        difficulty. This extension would challenge players further, offering an evolving and engaging
                        experience as they progress through more complex obstacles and encounters. The GitHub repository
                        for this project can be accessed <a
